<p>If you appreciate great architecture, then the Regent Grand Resort is the place for you.  This unique structure blends Italian sophistication with Caribbean laid-back cool.   Imagine - classic columns, travertine marble, cascading fountains and grand pavilions transplanted on a white sugary sand beach with turquoise blue water, golden hot sun and graceful swaying palm trees.  Perfecto!!!</p>
<p>The resort is comprised of only 50 units ranging in size from 1400 sq  ft â€“ 6500 sq ft.  It sits on 4.33 acres and fronts on to a 300 ft stretch of beach and offers a signature infinity edge pool and dual "cool" and "hot" outdoor Jacuzzis.  Property amenities includes: flood-lit tennis courts, state-of-the-art gym, spa services, golf (10 mins away), snorkeling, parasailing and other water sports.  Poolside, there is a private owners & guest bar serving tropical drinks and other intoxicating libations.  By design, there is no restaurant on-site. However, about 5 minutes away are some of Provo's' finest restaurants including: Anacaona, Coco Bistro, Iguanas, O'Soleil (Somerset).</p>
<p>This property is the perfect balance between ultimate privacy and convenient location.   Truly the best of both worlds!</p>
